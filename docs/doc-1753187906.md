## Track Your Western Union Transfer

This page allows you to track the status of your Western Union money transfer.

### How to Track a Transfer

To track a transfer, you will need to provide your 10-digit Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN). You will also need to specify if you are the sender or the receiver of the transfer.

**Steps:**
1.  Select whether you are the sender or the receiver.
2.  Enter your 10-digit MTCN.
3.  Click "Continue."

If you do not know your MTCN, there might be an option to retrieve it.

### Important Service Update (Iraq)

Currently, **INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK** is providing payout services in Iraq. Zain Cash wallet holders can push the transfer to their wallet to complete a transaction. Western Union apologizes for any inconvenience and is working to re-activate further networks in Iraq as soon as possible.
