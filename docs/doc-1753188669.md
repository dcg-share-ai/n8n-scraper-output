## Track Your Western Union Transfer

This page is designed to help you track your Western Union money transfer.

### How to Track a Transfer

To track your transfer:

1.  Go to the "Track a Transfer" section.
2.  Indicate whether you are the sender or the receiver.
3.  Enter your 10-digit tracking number (MTCN).
4.  Click "Continue."

If you do not know the MTCN, there might be an option to find it by selecting the country and language.

### Important Service Update (Iraq)

Currently, **INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK** is providing payout services in Iraq. Zain Cash wallet holders can push the transfer to their wallet to complete a transaction. Western Union is working to re-activate further networks as soon as possible.
