## USD to LBP Optional Exchange Service

BoB Finance offers an optional USD to LBP exchange service exclusively for its customers through "Beirut Exchange," a company licensed by the Central Bank of Lebanon.

**How the service works:**

*   BoB Finance clients will receive their incoming transfers in USD.
*   Upon receipt of the USD transfer, customers will also receive a corresponding receipt.
*   Clients are then offered the option to exchange either a partial amount or the total amount of their USD transfer into Lebanese Pounds (LBP) at the current exchange rate.
*   Once the customer confirms the exchange, the approved USD amount will be converted.
*   The customer will receive the equivalent amount in LBP.
*   A detailed receipt for the LBP transaction will also be provided to the customer.

**Important Note:** All USD amounts exchanged through this service will be sold exclusively to the Central Bank of Lebanon.
